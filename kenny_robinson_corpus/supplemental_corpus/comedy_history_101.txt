TITLE: The Def Jam Comedy of Canada: The Nubian Show

The Nubian Show — created by comedian Kenny Robinson — changed Canadian comedy forever. The Toronto showcase was the very first comedy show in Canada to feature comedians of color. Kenny and his monthly showcase at Yuk Yuk's are also the subject of the new documentary People of Comedy (now streaming on Crave). The Nubian Show helped launch comedians Russell Peters and Kevin Hart, and has welcomed the likes of Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, and Jamie Foxx through its doors. For over 30 years, The Nubian Show has given voice to comics of color, becoming a launchpad for global stars, a stage for fearless material, and a blueprint for what inclusive comedy can look like.
