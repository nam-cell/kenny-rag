NOTABLE QUOTES ABOUT KENNY:
- "The only godfather of Canadian comedy. He has helped more comics than any festival has." — Darren Frost
- "First and foremost, without Kenny there is no me." — Jean Paul
- "He'll never paint a pretty picture for you… 'listen, you've got to work on this, you can't do that.'" — Keesha Brownie
- "It's the show that made me work, sweat and fret. No other show has made me so nervous and excited at the same time." — Keesha Brownie

YOUTUBE NOTE:
Kenny Robinson has minimal YouTube presence. His career (1977–present) largely predates the YouTube era. Best video content: Crave documentary, Global News segment (free), CBC Q podcast (free audio). Upcoming New Metric Media standup special should provide first major modern streaming-available standup content.
