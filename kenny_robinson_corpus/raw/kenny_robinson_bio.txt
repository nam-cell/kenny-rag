"The Fabulous
Kenny Robinson" is a living legend on the Canadian Comedy scene. His irreverent,
socially conscience, intelligent, opinionated and profane style of
comedy has made him a fixture and favourite with comedy clubs,
festivals, swingers conventions, radio, and television audiences for 3
decades. Raunchy, energetic,
sharp witted, and sharp dressed; Kenny Robinson is a one of a kind act.
Not for the weak of heart or narrow minded. Kenny assaults your sensibilities
and funny bone with unspoken truths. Many of the country's
brightest young comics have claimed "The Fab" as a mentor and
influence. The Winnipeg born,
Chicago bred Robinson has hosted The Gemini Awards and was twice
nominated for his writing and performance in his ground breaking one hour
special "Thick and Thin" on the CBC. Kenny has earned
accolades as the creator, writer, producer and host of the edgy late
night series"After Hours with Kenny Robinson" on The Comedy Network. His episode of the
CBC's Comics has been referred by the Toronto Star as "One of the
few episodes that still stand with the test of time." For 2 years he was
one of the co hosts of "The Morning Rush" on Flow 93.5fm, Canada's
first black owned hip hop radio station. As an actor Kenny has
appeared in such films as "Third Miracle" with Ed Harris, "Down
To Earth" with Chris Rock, Clement Virgo's "Love comes Down", and
David Sutherland's "Love, Sex, and Eating the Bones." Robinson has appeared
on the CBC's "Royal Canadian Air Farce", Showtime's "Soul
Food", and has a wide fan base from his re-occurring roles as "Jelly
Bean" on PAX series "Doc", starring Billy Ray Cyrus, and as
"Mickey" on the teen fave "Radio Free Roscoe" on the
"Noggin" Network. Whether the audience
looks for his cutting observational perspectives, political, sexual or
what comes up at the moment, Kenny's professional attitude and love for
comedy will always deliver!
