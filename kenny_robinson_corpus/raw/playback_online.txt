New Metric Media introduces Eh-List standup comedy slate By Nicholas Sokic July 23, 2025

The prodco will produce and distribute standup specials and albums from an initial roster of six comedians.

Toronto-based prodco New Metric Media has launched a standup comedy slate, the Eh-List, and named the inaugural six comedians who will headline the roster of standup specials and albums. The slate will be entirely self-financed, produced and distributed by New Metric. Recordings are already underway at venues across Canada, according to a news release issued Wednesday (July 23). New Metric plans to distribute the specials via its own direct-to-consumer channels. While there are plans to partner with domestic platforms, the prodco is “actively pitching the slate to international platforms,” a New Metric spokesperson told Playback Daily . VP, standups and podcasts Ben Miner and production manager Logan Midroni are producing the slate, with each comic serving as executive producer for their own special. The Eh-List comedians include Winnipeg-born Kenny Robinson ( After Hours with Kenny Robinson ), Brampton, Ont.-born Zabrina Douglas and Toronto-born Ron Josol ( Video on Trial ). The list also includes L.A.-based Rebecca Kohler, who has also served as screenwriter for CBC series such as Workin’ Moms , Schitt’s Creek and Kim’s Convenience . Rounding out the comedians is Toronto-based Jared Nathan, an advocate and founder of Disability Privilege Productions, and Prince Albert, Sask.-born comic Kelly Taylor. “These six comedians are absolute humdingers and room-rocking standups. We will be very loud about just how incredible they are,” said Miner in a statement. “This country’s talent pool is deep and largely untapped, and we’re just getting started.” Further details, including additional comedians, will be announced in September, said the spokesperson.
