EXCLUSIVE: Buckle up for some good old Canadian comedy fun. Letterkenny producer New Metric Media is self-funding, producing and distributing a slate of standup comedy albums and specials, which will be known as The Eh-List . Recordings are taking place at venues across Canada. New Metric plans to distribute the content across its own direct-to-consumer channels, and to traditional domestic and international platforms. New Metric’s VP of Standup & Podcasts, Ben Miner, and Production Manager Logan Midroni are producing the slate, with each comic exec producing their own special.

Watch on Deadline This comes after New Metric appointed SiriusXM’s Miner to lead the new Podcast & Standup division earlier this year. Fewer and fewer Canadian production houses are purely relying on commissions from linear and streaming networks, and several have seen the country’s burgeoning standup scene as a source for new intellectual property. Robinson is considered by many the godfather of Canadian standup and since 1995 has hosted the Yuk Yuk’s club chain’s celebrated Nubian Disciples All-Black Comedy Revue – now the subject of Crave doc People of Comedy: Celebrating 30 Years of the Nubian Show . He also created and hosted The Comedy Network’s After Hours with Kenny Robinson and has acted in several films. Registered nurse and mom of five Douglas was nominated for Comedy Album of the Year for Things Black Girls Say and has appeared in People of Comedy , while Canadian-Filipino comic Josol has been performing standup internationally for 20 years. Kohler is a Canadian Comedy Award winner and Juno nominee, who has served as a screenwriter on CBC and Netflix’s Schitt’s Creek , Workin’ Moms and Kim’s Convenience , while Nathan is known for appearances on the Kill Tony podcast and owns Disability Privilege Productions, which is dedicated to advancing the entertainment careers of individuals with disabilities. Taylor is a three-time finalist in SiriusXM’s Canada’s Top Comic search and has worked in the business for two decades. “New Metric is a world-class, one-stop shop for Canadian comedians, and our new standup & Podcast division lives up to the successes we’ve had on the scripted side with Letterkenny , Shoresy , Children Ruin Everything , Bria Mack Gets A Life and more,” said Miner. “These six comedians are absolute humdingers and room-rocking standups. We will be very loud about just how incredible they are. This country’s talent pool is deep and largely untapped, and we’re just getting started.” Miner is planning to add more standup talent to The Eh-List roster in the coming months, along with a slate of podcasts and digital content.
