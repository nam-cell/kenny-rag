Comedian Kenny Robinson celebrates a milestone in entertainment By Neil Armstrong A documentary, âPeople of Comedy,â celebrating 30 years of Kenny Robinsonâs âThe Nubian Showâ recently premiered on CRAVE TV and he is thrilled by it and quite honoured. Kenny Robinson âA lot of people donât get to hear their Celebration of Life so in a way I did and Iâm proud of the accomplishments and the comedians,â he said jokingly, noting that it was Mr. Lewinâs first time getting on TV and he is proud that he was able to provide that platform. âHopefully, everybody moves forward including me.â Mr. Lewin is a character in a podcast described as âa comedic view on all of lifeâs important issues with a twist of sophistication and a hint of ignorance.â Robinson, a legend in Canadian entertainment, who has been doing comedy since 1977 said it is his call in life. âI didnât have the discipline to stay in school and get a law degree. This is my lifeâs passion; this is my lifeâs calling so this time hoping that next year will be a better year and that bigger things happen.â The Winnipeg-born, Chicago-bred comic has helped many comedians, providing a launch pad for their careers, and he said it has been very positive working with them. âThereâs been hundreds of comics that Iâve had an influence with, everything from trying to help them create material, to getting them on a show where they might be seen to get on TV, to helping them to get ready for âJust for Laughsâ â itâs been a lifetime,â said Robinson who holds a weekly workshop for comedians on Monday evenings at Blackhurst Cultural Centre in Toronto. Kenny Robinson and the zany Nubians He said some are making great leaps and bounds, and others are very slow and frustrating and he wonders if they are ever going to catch on. âBut the fact they keep coming back, youâre going to keep writing with them. Iâm trying to develop professionals; Iâm trying to show them all different parts of the industry.â The Nubian Show is held on the last Sunday of every month at Yuk Yuks Comedy Club and occasionally Robinson plays at some of their clubs. âIâve been speaking to some new people to be doing things differently in the fall,â noted Robinson who, tongue-in-cheek, said his last show will not be announced but will be read about in the paper â alluding to his death. âI will not be announcing my final show ever.â Robinson said he is talking with people about recording a special with him in concert so thatâs something thatâs just new on the board. âDepends on some of the feedback, you could go the series of me showcasing comics. Anything and everything is possible.â He has toured across North America winning both audiences and critical acclaim with his raucous, irreverent, profane and opinionated brand of “in your face” style of comedy and social commentary. He has appeared at the renowned Montreal Just for Laughs Comedy Festival, Laffapalooza Urban Comedy Festival in Atlanta, The CBC Winnipeg Comedy Festival, Zanies, L.A.’s Comedy Store and Improv, has had his own CBC television special of “Comics”, and is the founder of the Nubian Disciples All Black Comedy Revue, and Toronto’s Soul’d Out Comedy Festival. Over his career, Robinson has shared the stage with such comedians as Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, Jim Carrey, Norm McDonald, Russell Peters, Robert Schimmel, Tommy Davidson, Tommy Chong, Margaret Cho, Paul Mooney, Lenny Clark, Phyllis Diller, and the late, great, Sam Kinison. He has co-hosted The Gemini Awards, as well being twice nominated for his groundbreaking CBC television special “Thick and Thin”. Robinson was also the creator, writer and host of the Comedy Networks edgy show “After Hours,” and for two years, 2001-2003, was the co-host of FLOW 93.5 “Morning Rush” radio show. #KennyRobinson #TheNubianShow #CanadianComedy #BlackComedians #TorontoComedy #CraveTV #ComedyLegend #BlackExcellence #SupportBlackArtists #StandUpComedy #ComedyPioneer Kenny Robinson Celebrates 30 Years of The Nubian Show added by The Caribbean Camera Inc. on April 23, 2025 View all posts by The Caribbean Camera Inc. →
