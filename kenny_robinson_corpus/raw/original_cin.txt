============================================================

By Jim Slotek Three decades ago, comedian Kenny Robinson ’s fledgling Nubian Comedy Revue began attracting an enthusiastic Yuk Yuk’s audience that was unused to seeing an entire show of comedians of colour. So it was back then that I found myself at a table with Yuk Yuk’s founder Mark Breslin , the only white guys in a packed house. Robinson’s list of former hometowns includes one we shared on the outskirts of Winnipeg - Transcona (a town since swallowed up by the ‘Peg). I suggest to him that being the only non-white in the room might have been a more common experience.
